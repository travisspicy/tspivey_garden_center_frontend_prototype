This is a front end application for the PET Emporium API, despite the name being directed towards the Garden Center.
The design will have no database functionality and is just to show the product owners what the full application will LOOK like from a users standpoint.

1. Only use HTML, CSS and JS -
2. The page should have a navigation bar that shows a basic log-in page and a customers page
3. The customers page should only contain information that is relative to the customers information that is found in the API
4. The customers page should have controlls that would allow for editing/deleting data
5. The login page should have a log-in form


THIS IS ONLY FOR MOCKING PURPOSES, NO API FUNCTIONALITY
